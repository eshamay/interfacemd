/* This is an attempt to generate spectra for each individual coordination type of water molecules. The routine is rather obtuse, but I'll attempt to explain what's going on. First, what's expected:
	A single water molecule will remain in a given coordination for a finite amount of time before on h-bond breaks or forms, and thus changes its coordination. For this reason, if we want a spectrum for molecules with a given coordination, we cannot just grab all waters that start out in that coordination and monitor them over the trajectory; we must, therefor, pick out the parts of the trajectory for each molecule where it sits in the given coordination.
	An issue arises when we consider that a "good" spectrum requires a certain amount of timesteps, (i.e. we can't generate a meaningful spectrum from 50 timesteps) so what I've done here is a somewhat obfuscated system of building trajectory "chunks" for each water molecule over the trajectory for which they sit in the desired coordination. The chunks are only considered valid if they are a minimum number of timesteps (500?). If they are atleast this big, then the chunk is added to a pile of chunks of the trajectory for processing.
	Once all the pieces of the trajectory have been gathered for each coordination type, they are fourier-transformed into spectra, and then compiled into a single spectrum.
