/* This class performs various calculations in order to produce SFG spectra. The calculations all derive from the Morita and Hynes paper:

		A. Morita, J.T. Hynes, Chemical Physics 258 (2000) pp. 371-390
	
	The overall idea is that given a system trajectory for an aqueous surface, and the accompanying forces on each particle in the system, it is possible to produce SFG spectra for each timeframe. Various detailed calculations take place to find the shift in frequency of each OH-oscillator on each water molecule due to the forces it experiences from its environment. These shifts in frequency give rise to hyperpolarizabilities of the molecules, and the second-order susceptibility of the total (macroscopic) system. The intensity at each frequency is then calculated based on the chi-2 (second order susceptibility) magnitude. Review the paper above for further information on the procedure coded here.
